Creation of a Horde-Survival-Game with a static and adaptive Difficulty, made with the [Godot Game Engine.](https://godotengine.org/)

This game is a project developed as part of the academic module **ProMedi24** at **TU-Berlin** focused on media creation. It aims to explore different user experiences by implementing two modes of gameplay: one with a static difficulty level and another dynamic difficulty that adapts based on the player's skills.

**Supervisor:** Phillip Harnisch
