Creation of a Horde-Survival-Game with a static and adaptive Difficulty, made with the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

This game is a project developed as part of the academic module **ProMedi24** at **TU-Berlin** focused on media creation. It aims to explore different user experiences by implementing two modes of gameplay: one with a constant difficulty level and another dynamic difficulty that adapts based on the player's skills.

**Supervisor:** Phillip Harnisch

- [Godot-Rapier2D](https://github.com/appsinacup/godot-rapier-2d) by Apps in a Cup 

**ImGui** gives us the ability to create fast development user interfaces for monitoring and testing purposes. **Rapier2D** provides a more stable and performant physics and collision solution for the engine. The addons are already included in the repository.
