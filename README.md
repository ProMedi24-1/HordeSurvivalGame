A Survivors/Brotato-like game with a static and adaptive difficulty, made with the [Godot Game Engine.](https://godotengine.org/) (4.3-beta3)

This  project is developed as part of the academic module **Project Media Creation (2024)** at **TU-Berlin**. It aims to explore different user experiences by implementing
two difficulty modes in the gameplay: one with a static difficulty and another dynamic difficulty that adapts based on the player's skills.

**Supervisor:** Phillip Harnisch
